# Decision-Trees

This repository contains the implementation of Decision Trees which are widely used in supervised decision making based on conditional occurences. This exercise was a part of our coursework for the course 24-787 (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Engineering Design) at Carnegie Mellon University This Decision tree is an entropy based decision tree which is implemented in MATLAB.
